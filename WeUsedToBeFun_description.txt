We used to be fun.
Description: A podcast about our family of four.

ep001 (20190127): Our first episode! 
Let's talk about how are we going to do this podcast, some dogs we've had, horses, and an in-depth child review of Mulan II (2004).

ep002 (20190129): Sh*% got real
Things get serious in episode 2. Amy discusses the WSU strike, we go over some parenting triumphs and fails, and the kids do impressions of movie characters.

ep003 (20190206): That guy, he's a douche.
What are bad habits that we selfishly want to let our kids do, even if its not good for them? What are our least favorite parenting responsibilities, and favorite things to do as a family? We eat some kettle cooked potato chips whilst podcasting, argue about what age kids should get a tv and/or cell phone, Amy trash talks the late Steve Jobs, and the kids do animal impressions.

The third and final episode of this series. Mostly more rapid fire, but it was getting pretty late and everyone was a little tipsy, hungry, and volume levels varied significantly!
